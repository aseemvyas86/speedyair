        > Search all flights from flightschedule
        > Add in tuple list of flights and set index to 0 because it is the first one
        > Add order to orderScheduled list
        
     - key  ---> destination exist in Dictionary
        > Retrive the value of particular key
        > Add the order of a current flight 
        > Fill upto capacity of the flight
        > Update the tuple with updated flight and increment index of tuple
        > Update the Dictonary 
        > Add order in orderScheduled list
    iv. Return the orderScheduled list
